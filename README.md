# SmartTravel

SmartTravel is a productivity-focused Android application that uses a travel-themed interface to help users structure and complete their study or work tasks through the Pomodoro method.

---

## Overview
SmartTravel transforms study sessions into travel-inspired “flights” to improve motivation and focus. Users can create tasks (Destinations), start Pomodoro study sessions (Flights), take structured breaks (Layovers), and review their progress through historical tracking (Past Flights).

This project was created for COM-437: Mobile Application Development at Saint Leo University.
